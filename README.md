# P-Sim
 While initially supposed to be the early early stages of a simple physics simulator, it has turned into a small game engine project written with DirectX11.
 Learning how to do the very basic rendering is in the late stages and this project has now turned towards engine frameworks, more complex graphics, etc.
 
 What this shall eventually become I have no clue. But as of now much of this is me learning.
 
 The 3d rendering code is mostly following the Braynzar soft D3D11 tutorial and the recent ECS code is taken and adapted from Austin Morlan's implementation. Both of these can easily be found on google so Im not gonna go find those links.
